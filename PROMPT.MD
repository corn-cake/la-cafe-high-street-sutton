## Owner Story — Ankur Baria

**Background:**
- 26+ years of fine dining and hospitality experience
- Trained at the Institute of Hotel Management
- Taj Management Trainee — one of the youngest to achieve senior management at age 24
- Has served world leaders including Bill and Hillary Clinton

**The LA Café Journey:**
Ankur opened LA Café on May 13, 2021, during the COVID pandemic, investing his life savings. The first two years were brutal — "I did not earn a single penny. We had to put money into the café to operate it, because being on the High Street, the rents are crazy here."

What began as quality coffee, cakes, and brunch quickly evolved when Ankur realized Sutton hungered for something more ambitious. The turning point came with the Bacon Sausage Baps with signature white truffle sauce — when customers said "This is like something I'd get in a Michelin restaurant," he knew they had something special.

**Philosophy:**
> "I've always believed great food shouldn't be reserved for the elite."
> "We don't chase trends. We chase excellence and authenticity."
> "We can make the greatest things with the simplest things."

**Vision:** Looking ahead, Ankur plans to grow LA Café as a creative and community space, with seasonal tasting menus and an all-day-dining concept — "never at the cost of quality."
